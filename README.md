# Url-shortener

This url-shortener was developed in 2 days for the 6.148 MIT Web Programming
Competition running over IAP.

Generally, all the staff members should know the shared password to make their
account "admin" and then they can add/edit any url.

The 6.148 staff uses shortened links to give to students to access materials (as
opposed to giving them long links to, say, google drive files). In addition to
that, staff uses short links to quickly collaborate on multiple documents in
Slack and on the mailing list.


## Setup

Run with `meteor`. Don't forget to setup your own password for making yourself
an admin.
